# React Native Weather App

Created this as app as I am learning React Native for mobile app development. This app is a simple weather app that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather data. 

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo and run `npm install`:

```
$ git clone
$ cd react-native-weather-app
$ npm install
```

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Installing

To run the app, you will need to have the Expo CLI installed. You can install it by running the following command:

```
$ npm install -g expo-cli
```

Once you have Expo installed, you can run the app by running the following command:

```
$ expo start
```

This will start the Expo development server and open up a browser window with a QR code. You can then use the Expo app on your phone to scan the QR code and run the app on your phone.
